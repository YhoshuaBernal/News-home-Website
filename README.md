## Overview

### The challenge

- Build a responsive page for different screen sizes with interactivity using JavaScript.
- I used ITCSS architecture along with SCSS for its ease of reading and writing for a more modular and scalable design.
- It's my first time using a CSS architecture, I would greatly appreciate feedback.
